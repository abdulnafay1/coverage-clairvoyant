# CareClaim

CareClaim is an AI-powered insurance assistant that helps people file stronger claims and successfully appeal denials.

We turn complex insurance documents into clear, actionable guidance — so patients can recover the coverage they already paid for.

## 🚨 The Problem

Health insurance denials are far more common than most people realize.

- Over **73 million claims** are denied each year in the U.S.
- **15–20%** of in-network claims face initial denial
- Americans hold **$220+ billion** in medical debt

But the biggest issue isn’t denial itself.

## 💡 The Core Insight

The appeals process works — people just don’t use it.

- Only **2% of denied claims are appealed**
- Yet **90% of appeals succeed** partially or fully

This gap exists because patients lack time, knowledge, and tools to navigate complex insurance language.

CareClaim exists to close that gap.
